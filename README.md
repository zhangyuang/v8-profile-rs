# Introduction

[v8-profiler-rs](https://github.com/zhangyuang/v8-profiler-rs) is a project developed in `Rust` for intelligent online analysis of `V8 heapsnapshot` files. It helps developers using V8-based applications like `Node.js/Chrome/Deno/Electron` to better understand program memory structure and assist in locating memory leaks.

## Online Demo

We have deployed an [online website](https://v8.ssr-fc.com/) where you can upload and analyze V8 memory snapshots in real-time. We recommend using `Safari` or `Firefox` browsers, as `wasm` execution performance is significantly better than in `Chrome` .

## Why Rust

Parsing V8 memory snapshots involves a lot of computational operations. CPU-intensive scenarios are inherently not JavaScript's strong suit.

After reading Chrome's official memory analysis tool source code, I found it uses many tricks to ensure performance, making the code highly complex and difficult to maintain.

Rust is perfect for this scenario, providing excellent performance while maintaining code readability. Rust's superior multi-threading capabilities are exactly what we need, as parsing computation logic is ideal for multi-threaded optimization. We will continue optimizing computational performance in future versions.

This application's approach can be applied to any programming language with GC. We will strive to support memory analysis for more programming languages in the future.

Finally, Rust's official WebAssembly support is excellent, allowing us to easily compile Rust code to WebAssembly for browser use.

## Handling Parse Timeout Issues

For very large files, you may encounter Wasm memory overflow or long parse times. If this occurs, try using `Safari` or `Firefox` browsers.

## How to use

Open the [online demo](https://v8.ssr-fc.com/) and upload the `heapsnapshot` file. You can upload one or two files for comparison.

There will render heapsnapshot nodes in web page.

The node fields are as follows:

```js
{
    "node_type": string; // node type
    "name": string; // node name
    "id": number; // node id
    "size": number; // node self size
    "edge_count": number; // node edge count
    "retained_size": number; // node retained size, the free size of the node after GC
    "pt": number; // the ratio of self size / retained size
    "edges": {
        "edge_type": string; // edge type
        "to_node": number; // the id of the node that the edge points to
        "name_or_index": string; // the name or indexï¼ˆfor arrayï¼‰ of the edge
    } [];
    "source": string; // the source file of the node
    "constructor": string; // the constructor of the node
    "percent": string; // the retained size ratio of the node
}
```
